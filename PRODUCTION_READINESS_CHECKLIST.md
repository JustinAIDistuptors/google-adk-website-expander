# Production Readiness Checklist: Automated Website Expansion Framework

This document outlines the necessary tasks to bring the Automated Website Expansion Framework to a production-grade ready application. Each item can be assigned and tracked.

## I. Core Infrastructure & Backend

- [ ] **1.1. Database Implementation:**
    - [ ] Task: Decide on and implement a robust database system (PostgreSQL is hinted at by `psycopg2-binary`).
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] Define schema for task queue, content storage (SEO data, generated content, assembled pages), agent states, and potentially logging/monitoring.
        - [ ] Refactor `src/utils/queue_manager.py` to use the database instead of JSON files.
        - [ ] Refactor data loading/saving in agents (Content Generator, Page Assembler, Publisher) to use the database.
        - [ ] Update `scripts/init_data.py` to initialize/migrate the database schema and load initial data into the database.

- [ ] **1.2. Backend API Development (Optional but Recommended for UI/External Programmatic Access):**
    - [ ] Task: Design and develop a FastAPI (or similar) backend API.
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] Define API endpoints for:
            - [ ] Managing tasks (create, view status, prioritize).
            - [ ] Viewing generated content and pages.
            - [ ] Triggering and monitoring the orchestration process.
            - [ ] Managing configurations.
        - [ ] Integrate with the database for data retrieval and storage.
        - [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for API endpoints.

## II. Agent Functionality Enhancement

- [ ] **2.1. Content Generator Agent:**
    - [ ] Task: Enhance content generation quality and robustness.
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] Implement robust structured JSON output parsing from LLM (e.g., using Pydantic models for validation, retry mechanisms for formatting errors).
        - [ ] Develop programmatic content quality checks (word count, keyword density, plagiarism - potentially via API, readability).
        - [ ] Implement content revision loops based on quality checks.
        - [ ] Explore advanced prompt engineering (e.g., section-by-section generation for complex templates, chain-of-thought).
        - [ ] Integrate actual "tools" if beneficial (e.g., for fact-checking, fetching fresh examples).

- [ ] **2.2. Page Assembler Agent:**
    - [ ] Task: Implement a proper HTML templating system and assembly logic.
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] Integrate a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2). Store HTML templates in files (`data/templates/` is configured but not properly used).
        - [ ] Refactor `_get_html_template()` to load templates from files.
        - [ ] Develop logic to map structured JSON content from Content Generator to template placeholders.
        - [ ] Implement dynamic and configurable schema.org markup generation based on `seo_parameters.yaml`.
        - [ ] Add HTML validation (linting) and sanitization.
        - [ ] Manage CSS/JS asset linking appropriately.

- [ ] **2.3. Publisher Agent:**
    - [ ] Task: Implement real CMS integration and sitemap management.
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] Replace mock `publish_page_tool` with actual CMS API client code (e.g., for WordPress using its REST API, considering `publishing_config.yaml`).
        - [ ] Implement secure handling of CMS authentication (OAuth, API keys).
        - [ ] Map assembled HTML/metadata to CMS fields.
        - [ ] Implement `verification_enabled` logic (HTTP check of published URL).
        - [ ] Implement `rollback_on_failure` logic if feasible.
        - [ ] Replace mock `update_sitemap_tool` with real sitemap generation (XML) and submission (upload to server or via CMS, notify search engines via API as per `publishing_config.yaml`).
        - [ ] Ensure all relevant settings from `publishing_config.yaml` are utilized.

## III. Configuration and Security

- [ ] **3.1. API Key and Secrets Management:**
    - [ ] Task: Ensure all required API keys and sensitive configurations are set up and securely managed.
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] **GCP Project ID:** Set `global.project_id` (e.g., via `.env`).
        - [ ] **CMS Credentials:** Configure `website.base_url`, `website.api_endpoint`, and actual authentication credentials (OAuth, API key, or basic auth) in `.env` or a secure vault.
        - [ ] **Google Search Console API:** Set up credentials if sitemap submission is to be automated.
        - [ ] **Email Service:** Configure if `notify_admin_email` requires sending emails via a service.
        - [ ] **SEO Tool API Keys:** Add to `.env` if SEO Research Agent tools are to use external APIs.
        - [ ] Ensure no secrets are hardcoded.

## IV. Testing and Reliability

- [ ] **4.1. Integration Testing:**
    - [ ] Task: Develop and implement end-to-end integration tests for the entire workflow.

- [ ] **4.2. Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery:**
    - [ ] Task: Improve error handling across all agents and services with more specific error catching, retry mechanisms, and potential fallback strategies.

## V. Deployment and Operations

- [ ] **5.1. Production Deployment Configuration:**
    - [ ] Task: Define and implement a production deployment strategy.
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] Containerization (e.g., Docker).
        - [ ] Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Cloud Run).
        - [ ] Configuration management for different environments.

- [ ] **5.2. Monitoring and Logging:**
    - [ ] Task: Implement comprehensive monitoring and structured logging.
    - [ ] Details:
        - [ ] Expand `scripts/monitoring.py` or integrate with dedicated monitoring tools.
        - [ ] Ensure structured logs for easier analysis.
        - [ ] Implement `monitoring` settings from `publishing_config.yaml`.

- [ ] **5.3. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements:**
    - [ ] Task: Improve the existing CI/CD pipeline.
    - [ ] Details: Add automated testing (unit, integration), linting, security scanning, and automated deployment.

## VI. Documentation

- [ ] **6.1. Documentation Expansion:**
    - [ ] Task: Expand project documentation.
    - [ ] Details: API documentation (if API is built), detailed user guides, troubleshooting information.
