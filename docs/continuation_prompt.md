# Google ADK Website Expansion Framework - Continuation Prompt

You're working on developing an automated website expansion framework using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. This system is designed to autonomously generate and publish thousands of location-based service pages.

You've already implemented the core repository structure and have started developing the specialized agent components for this system. You should refer to the comprehensive project documentation to understand the full scope, architecture, and implementation details of this project.

The system uses a multi-agent architecture with these specialized components:
1. Orchestrator Agent - Manages workflow and task delegation
2. SEO Research Agent - Gathers keywords and competitive intelligence
3. Content Generator Agent - Creates unique page content based on templates
4. Page Assembly Agent - Builds complete HTML pages
5. Publishing Agent - Integrates with the website to deploy pages

## Your Tasks

Continue implementing and refining the Google ADK Website Expansion Framework according to the architecture and specifications outlined in the project documentation. Focus on:

1. Enhancing the agent implementations with improved tools and intelligence
2. Implementing the integration points between agents
3. Developing the monitoring and reporting capabilities
4. Setting up proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Creating test scenarios to validate the system's functionality

Use Google ADK's best practices and refer to the documentation for implementation details. Maintain the established project structure and coding conventions.

If you need to review the current implementation before continuing, ask to see specific files or components from the repository.

Approach this methodically by focusing on one component or aspect at a time, and document your progress as you go.
